- Added SetLooping() - suggested by DubMFG
- Added SetMaxFPS()
- Removed all chat message prints
- Removed inventory wheel display on bench start

2021-12-10 [v1.4.6]
- Map data loading now looks for a file named 'bm_mapname.nut' first, then 'bm_mapname <- {}' inside the resource file.
- Setup functions can now be loaded from the data file 'bm_mapname.nut'.

2021-07-08 [v1.4.5]
- Fixed a bug that could cause inconsistencies in flashbang blindings depending on player's world angles

	Effects of this change is rectified in existing setups (with 6 frame margin of error).
- Remade the de_dust2 path with b-splines and D3DX angle interpolator to make it more fluid
